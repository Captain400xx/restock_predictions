Pok√©mon Card Restock Forecasting App

This Streamlit application uses a combination of time-series and machine learning models to forecast Pok√©mon TCG restocks from various online retailers. It's designed to identify high-probability restock windows by finding a consensus among four different forecasting models.

Features

Multi-Model Ensemble: Combines predictions from Prophet, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost for higher confidence.

Prediction Schedule: A color-coded schedule that highlights upcoming restock windows and ranks them by confidence level (High, Medium, Low).

2-Week Accuracy View: A special chart that compares the model's forecast for the past week against actual historical data, providing a visual check on accuracy.

In-Depth Analysis: Includes heatmaps to visualize the most active days of the month and hours of the day for restocks.

Feature Importance: Shows which factors (e.g., time of day, day of week) are most influential in making predictions.

Customizable UI: Includes a simple color picker to customize chart appearances.

How to Run Locally

Prerequisites

Python 3.9+

pip for package installation

1. Clone the Repository

Version History:

v4.0 - Major Accuracy & UI Overhaul
This version introduces a significant upgrade to the underlying models for improved accuracy and adds several new UI features for better analysis and usability.

üß† Major Model Overhaul
Advanced Feature Engineering: The ML models (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) now use a much richer feature set for higher accuracy, including:

Lag Features: To teach models about momentum (e.g., activity_24_hours_ago).

Cyclical Features: To help models understand the circular nature of time (e.g., that 11 PM is next to 12 AM).

Contextual Features: To provide human context (e.g., is_weekend, is_business_hours), which helps prevent incorrect predictions like weekend restocks for retailers who operate on weekdays only.

Poisson Objective: The models have been retuned with a 'Poisson' objective, which is statistically better for predicting the frequency of spikes and rare events.

‚ú® New Features & UI Enhancements
New Tab: "2-Week View": A powerful new chart that overlaps the past 7 days of actual data with the model's forecast, allowing for an immediate visual check on prediction accuracy.

New "Prediction Schedule" Chart: The main tab now includes a visual bar chart of upcoming predictions, color-coded by confidence level.

New "Data Summary": The sidebar now displays key statistics for the selected retailer, including the date range of available data and the total number of recorded events.

New "Chart Color Picker": A control has been added to the sidebar to allow customization of the main forecast line color.
